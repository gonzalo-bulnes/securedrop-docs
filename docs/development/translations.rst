Translations
============

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

SecureDrop is a system that lets people share sensitive information
with investigative journalists anonymously and securely.
Learn :ref:`more about SecureDrop <what_is_securedrop>`.

SecureDrop is written in English and translated in multiple
other languages. Translations are managed using **Weblate**,
a web platform that enables collaborative translation projects.

.. _get_started_using_weblate:

Get started using Weblate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can choose to :ref:`register on Weblate <how_to_register_on_weblate_email>`
with your email address, or by linking a GitHub account.

You can contribute to any language, but Weblate has some conveniences
to make it easier to work with your preferred languages.
Learn :ref:`how to choose your preferred languages on Weblate <how_to_manage_your_preferred_languages_weblate>`.

Our Weblate instance only contains one project, SecureDrop, which has
two translation components: the main SecureDrop web application (labeled
"SecureDrop"), and the translations for the desktop icons of the admin
and journalist workstations used by news organizations (labeled "desktop").

Once a string is translated, it must be approved by a :ref:`reviewer <weblate_glossary_reviewer>`
before being accepted into SecureDrop.

Approved strings can only be modified by reviewers.
However, translators can still suggest modifications and make comments
if they notice something wrong.
SecureDrop translations are a collaborative endeavour!

Learn :ref:`how to translate SecureDrop using Weblate <how_to_translate_a_language_weblate>`.

.. _getting_help_translations:

Getting help
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Should you need help, you can do one of the following:

* Post a message in the `translation category of the SecureDrop forum`_
* Chat in the `SecureDrop instant messaging channel`_
* Read the `Weblate documentation`_

Background Information
----------------------

.. _what_is_securedrop:

What is SecureDrop?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SecureDrop is a system that lets people share sensitive information
with investigative journalists anonymously and securely. It's designed
to protect its users with strong cryptography and network
communications that hide locations and activity. For more information:

* Learn about :doc:`what makes SecureDrop unique <../what_makes_securedrop_unique>`..
* Watch `The Globe and Mail guide to using SecureDrop <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSW2wMWtAMM>`_.
* Read the `Localization Lab "Ask Me Anything" on SecureDrop <https://www.localizationlab.org/blog/2018/4/20/4bp1j2olispup45z8o2mm5nb5snxm2>`_.

.. _who_uses_securedrop:

Who uses SecureDrop?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two kinds of SecureDrop users: :doc:`Sources <../source>`
and :doc:`Journalists <../journalist>`. A source is an individual who
wants to communicate securely and anonymously with a
journalist. Sources are not expected to have any technical
background. Journalists using SecureDrop have usually received proper
training and understand the basic workflow of SecureDrop.

.. _how_is_securedrop_translated:

How is SecureDrop translated?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SecureDrop is translated using the **Weblate** platform. :ref:`Get started using Weblate <get_started_using_weblate>`

Sources, journalists and admins use localized versions of SecureDrop. A malicious actor could attempt to modify their behavior by creating misleading translations. In order to mitigate that risk, all translations must be reviewed and accepted by designated :ref:`reviewers <weblate_glossary_reviewer>` before they become part of SecureDrop.

.. _how_to_change_an_existing_translation:

How to change an existing translation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you think a translation can be improved, please don't run roughshod
over another translator's work. Make a suggestion or comment first, to
allow discussion before saving your changes.

Exceptions to this policy would be:

- Obvious errors in spelling, grammar, or punctuation.

- A string in our interface that is supposed to match another
  project. For example, we include instructions for adjusting Tor
  Browser settings, so if our wording is out of date, it has to be
  corrected to reduce confusion for people using SecureDrop.

In those cases, please feel free to correct the existing translation.

.. _how_to_translate_a_phrase_with_placeholders:

How to translate a phrase with placeholders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Source strings may contain placeholder text in curly braces, for
example ``{count}``. These represent variable content (like a
username, as in the example below), and must be left unmodified, but
they can be moved around in a string. For instance::

  Edit user {user}

might be displayed to the user as::

  Edit user Jean-Claude

The French translated string should look like::

  Modifier l'utilisateur {user}

And it would be **incorrect** to translate the placeholder like so::

  Modifier l'utilisateur {utilisateur}

.. _how_to_translate_a_phrase_with_html_code:

How to translate a phrase with HTML code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some :ref:`source strings <weblate_glossary_source_string>` represent HTML that will be presented in the
SecureDrop web interface.

HTML elements (embraced by in ``<``, ``>``, example: ``<strong>``)
can contain multiple so-called *attributes*.

The text of the two attributes called ``alt`` and ``title``
should be translated. The text of the other attributes should not
be translated.

Attribute ``alt``
"""""""""""""""""

Image elements (``<img>``) in HTML place a picture on the
page. Because people with visual impairments rely on a special note
on the image element -- the ``alt`` attribute -- to describe the image,
it is necessary to translate those. Here's an example that contains an
image with both an ``alt`` attribute *and* a placeholder::

  <img src="{icon}" alt="shield icon">

As explained above, the placeholder ``{icon}`` in the ``src``
attribute of the ``<img>`` element should not be translated. The
``alt`` attribute text (``"shield icon"``) should be. The correctly
translated HTML in Portuguese would be::

  <img src="{icon}" alt="ícone do escudo">

Attribute ``title``
"""""""""""""""""""

Links (``<a>``) and abbreviations (``<abbr>``) sometimes rely on
an additional ``title`` attribute. The content of that attribute is
usually shown when placing a cursor over the link or abbreviation.
::

  <a id="recommend-tor" title="How to install Tor Browser" href="{url}">Learn how to install it</a>

It is necessary to translate the contents of any ``title`` attribute.
The correctly translated HTML in Spanish would be::

  <a id="recommend-tor" title="Cómo instalar Tor Browser" href="{url}">Aprenda cómo instalarlo</a>

As explained above, the text content ``recommend-tor`` of the ``id``
attribute in the ``<a>`` element should not be translated. Neither
should the ``{url}`` placeholder of ``href`` attribute. Only the text
content of the ``title`` attribute (``"How to install Tor Browser"``)
should be translated.

Other attributes
""""""""""""""""

No attribute other than ``alt`` and ``title`` should be translated.

In particular, please make sure the attributes ``class``, ``id``,
``height``, ``href``, ``rel``, ``src`` and ``width``
are never translated.

.. _how_to_use_language_glossaries_on_weblate:

How to use the language glossaries on Weblate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Weblate contains an internal glossary for each language, to which
we can add suggested translations. If a :ref:`source string <weblate_glossary_source_string>` contains terms
from this glossary, the glossary entries will be displayed in a box on
the right side of the translation page.

.. figure:: ../images/weblate/glossary-sidebar.png
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 80%
   :width: 100%

   Glossary sidebar in Weblate. Click on the image to see it full-size.

If you find that a *source string* contains terms from the
:doc:`SecureDrop glossary <../glossary>` or the `EFF Surveillance
Self-Defense glossary`_, but the glossary sidebar says ``No related strings found in the glossary.``,
we'd really appreciate it if you could add those terms to
the glossary of the language you're working with.

.. _how_to_add_a_new_language:

How to add a new language to SecureDrop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We love seeing SecureDrop translated into new languages. Just ask us
to add yours by posting in the `translation category of the SecureDrop
forum`_.

.. _weblate_glossary:

Glossary
--------

Weblate contains an internal glossary for each language, to which
we can add suggested translations. Learn more about
:ref:`using language glossaries on Weblate <how_to_use_language_glossaries_on_weblate>`.

If a term is missing from the glossary for the language
you're translating into, you can refer to the following
technical glossaries for additional context. Then you can contribute
to improving your own language glossary on Weblate by suggesting
a translation yourself!

- The :doc:`SecureDrop glossary <../glossary>` explains terms specific
  to SecureDrop.
- The `EFF Surveillance Self-Defense glossary`_ explains many general
  security concepts.

Additionally, here is a list of terms that are specific to the usage of Weblate for SecureDrop.

.. _weblate_glossary_reviewer:

Reviewer
^^^^^^^^

Reviewers are people who are trusted to review and accept new translations into SecureDrop.

.. _weblate_glossary_source_string:

Source string
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Weblate, the phrases being translated are called *source strings*. (No relation with the terms *source* and *journalist* in SecureDrop.)

Source strings are English phrases and are automatically extracted from SecureDrop's code. Because of that, they can only be modified by developers outside Weblate. Learn :ref:`how to suggest changes to a source string <how_to_suggest_changes_to_a_source_string>`.
